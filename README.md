# Facebook UI

## Description
Friday July 19th I challenged myself to see if I could recreate the Facebook UI with Vue.js and Vuetify. I wanted this to be a little different than a direct close so I went to dribble and found a design which I really liked and tried to re-create it.

The end result is what you see in this project [here](https://uzirthapa.github.io/facebook-ui/dist/)
